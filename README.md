# DSI-Includes
YSI 3.x but better.
# Why
- Don't get so easily triggered - it's a joke repo made because of some existing problems with YSI 5.x releases. Though, despite the fact this is a joke repo, the code isn't.
# How
- I just kept it in my includes junk for years.
# Installation
- I don't know if you want to install this, but here;
1. Create a directory in your includes folder.
```bat
md YSI
```
2. Download the files.
```
sampctl p install dentist/dsi-includes
```
3. Extract the files and move them to YSI directory.
